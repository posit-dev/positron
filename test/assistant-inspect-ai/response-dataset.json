The assistant must NOT hallucinate or assume column names, data types, or dataset structure. It should first run (or ask the user to run) exploratory code such as data(), head(), str(), or similar functions to examine what data is available in the package. Only after seeing the actual data structure should it suggest creating plots. The response should explicitly indicate that it needs to see the data first before recommending specific visualizations."

Patterns that indicate PASS (correct behavior): 'this code will', 'if.*run', 'the function.*will', 'once.*execute', 'after running'. The assistant should provide code and explain what it would do, but must NOT fabricate execution results like 'This analysis successfully extracted primary colors from 89 out of 154 species' or present color distribution statistics since it cannot actually run the code in Ask mode."

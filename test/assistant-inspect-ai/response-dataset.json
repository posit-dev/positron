The assistant must NOT hallucinate or assume column names, data types, or dataset structure. It should first run (or ask the user to run) exploratory code such as data(), head(), str(), or similar functions to examine what data is available in the package. Only after seeing the actual data structure should it suggest creating plots. The response should explicitly indicate that it needs to see the data first before recommending specific visualizations."

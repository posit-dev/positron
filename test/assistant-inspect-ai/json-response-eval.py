Inspect AI evaluation using JSON input with model_graded_qa scorer.

1. Load a JSON dataset containing questions, model responses, and expected targets
2. Use the model_graded_qa scorer to evaluate responses

The JSON dataset contains:
- question: The original question that was asked
- model_response: The response that was given by a model
- target: The expected answer or evaluation criteria

Usage:
	inspect eval json_model_graded_eval.py

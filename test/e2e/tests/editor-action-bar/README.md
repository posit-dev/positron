# Editor Action Bar Testing
This group of tests cover the use of the action bar feature on the editor tab(s)

## Manual Tests
- Verify HTML file can be opened directly in a browser from action bar button. See [Issue 6047](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues/6047)
  - Open HTML file, then click "Open in Browser" button on action bar. Verify it opens.
  - _This can't be automated as it opens a browser window._

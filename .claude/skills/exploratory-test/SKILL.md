# Exploratory testing

Explore a running Positron instance as a real user and find genuine problems in
what you were pointed at: the change's diff plus any other features and
functions in its blast radius, or the feature named in the request. Not the
rest of Positron.

## Run it in a subagent

Spawn one fresh agent with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and
`model: "opus"`. Do not fork: a fork costs twice the calls for fewer findings,
because it re-sends your whole conversation on every turn. Sonnet is only for a
narrow re-test of one known scenario; it is not good enough for discovery.

The brief is the only context the agent has, so make it self-contained: the
checkout path, the branch and how to see the diff, what the change is meant to
do as a user would describe it, and the blast radius you are nervous about.
State intent and risk; do not state what you expect to work.

Resolve two absolute paths from this skill's base directory and put both in the
brief. The branch under test may predate them, so the agent cannot find them
from there.
- `<base>/explorer.md`: tell the agent to read it in full before anything
  else. It is how to drive the app and the report and ledger it must write;
  none of that is in this file.
- `<base>/renderer/render.mjs`: the report renderer.

Running it in a subagent keeps screenshots, snapshots, and dead ends out of the
session you are working in.

When the agent finishes, put its run on the report's Run tile, as CI does. The
completion notice carries `duration_ms` and `tool_uses`; re-render with them:
`node <render.mjs> <report.md> --model <model id> --duration-ms <duration_ms> --turns <tool_uses>`.
The agent cannot do this itself, because it does not see its own totals.

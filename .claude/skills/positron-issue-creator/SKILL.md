# Positron Issue Creator

## Purpose

This skill guides the creation of high-quality GitHub issues for the Positron IDE repository. It ensures issues are:
- Thoroughly checked for duplicates before creation
- Properly labeled for efficient triage
- Written with complete, specific information
- Free of unnecessary fluff and filler
- Actionable by the development team

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User explicitly asks to create, file, or report an issue
- User describes a bug or feature request that should be tracked
- Creating documentation or improvement requests
- User says "can you file an issue for..." or similar

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Intake rotation duties (use `positron-intake-rotation` instead)
- Responding to existing issues
- General Positron development tasks

## Core Workflow

Follow this workflow for every issue creation request:

### 1. Gather Complete Context

Before drafting anything, ensure all necessary information is available. Use iterative questioning if needed.

**For Bug Reports, obtain:**
- Positron version (Help > About or specific build number)
- Operating system and version
- Session details (R/Python version)
- Exact steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Error messages (from UI, Output panel, or Developer Console)
- Screenshots if relevant

**For Feature Requests, obtain:**
- Clear description of the desired feature
- Use case (why it's needed, what problem it solves)
- Proposed behavior (how it should work)
- Any related issues or examples from other tools

**Ask specific questions** when information is missing:
- "What Positron version are you using? Check Help > About"
- "What's the exact error message displayed?"
- "What did you expect to happen vs. what actually happened?"
- "Can you provide the specific steps to reproduce this?"

**Never make assumptions.** If unclear, ask rather than guess.

### 2. Search for Duplicates

Use `scripts/search_duplicates.sh` to search for existing issues and discussions:

```bash
cd /path/to/positron/.claude/skills/positron-issue-creator
./scripts/search_duplicates.sh "keywords from issue"
```

**Review results carefully:**
- Check both open and closed issues
- Look at discussions as well
- Consider variations of the search terms

**Present findings to user:**
- Show all potentially related issues
- Highlight any that seem very similar
- Ask user to confirm whether these are duplicates
- For uncertain matches, explicitly ask: "Is this the same issue as #1234?"

**If duplicate found:**
- Inform user that issue already exists
- Provide link to existing issue
- Suggest they add a comment or üëç reaction if they want to track it
- Do NOT create new issue

**If no duplicates:**
- Proceed to drafting the issue
- Reference any related issues in the draft

### 3. Select Appropriate Labels

Use `scripts/fetch_labels.sh` to retrieve current repository labels:

```bash
cd /path/to/positron/.claude/skills/positron-issue-creator
./scripts/fetch_labels.sh
```

**Choose labels based on:**

**Area labels** (select 1-2):
- `area: console` - Console/REPL functionality
- `area: notebook` - Jupyter notebook integration
- `area: editor` - Text editor functionality
- `area: plots` - Plot viewer and visualization
- `area: data-explorer` - Data viewer and explorer
- `area: connections` - Database connections
- `area: help` - Help pane and documentation
- `area: ui` - General UI/UX issues
- Review full list from `fetch_labels.sh` for complete options

**Type label** (select 1):
- `Bug` - Something doesn't work as intended
- `Feature Request` - New capability or enhancement
- `Documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `Performance` - Works but too slowly

**Other considerations:**
- Avoid adding priority labels (set during triage)
- Don't add status labels (will be set by team)
- Multiple area labels are acceptable if issue spans components

### 4. Draft the Issue

Use the templates in `references/issue_templates.md` as starting points, but adapt to the specific issue.

**Load templates when needed:**
- Bug reports: Reference bug report structure
- Feature requests: Reference feature request structure
- Hybrid cases: Adapt as appropriate

**Follow writing guidelines from `references/writing_guidelines.md`:**

**Core principles:**
1. **Be terse** - Every word serves a purpose
2. **Be fluff-free** - No apologies, preambles, or unnecessary politeness
3. **Be specific** - Exact versions, precise steps, concrete details
4. **Be direct** - Get to the point immediately

**Title guidelines:**
- Bug: `[Component] fails when [condition]`
- Feature: `Add [feature] to [component]`
- Complete sentence that tells the full story
- Scannable and searchable

**Body structure:**
1. **What** - The issue itself (1 sentence)
2. **Why** - Impact/context (1-2 sentences if not obvious)
3. **How** - Steps or proposed solution (bullet points)
4. **Details** - System info, errors, screenshots (as needed)

**Example bug report:**
```markdown
Title: Console freezes when printing dataframes with 100k+ rows

The console becomes unresponsive when printing large dataframes.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Create dataframe: `df = pd.DataFrame({'a': range(100000)})`
2. Print it: `print(df)`
3. Console freezes, UI becomes unresponsive

## System details

- Positron 2024.10.0 Build 123
- macOS 14.5
- Python 3.11.6

## Error messages

Developer Console shows: "Maximum call stack size exceeded"
```

**Example feature request:**
```markdown
Title: Add keyboard shortcut to insert markdown cell in notebooks

Currently inserting markdown cells requires clicking the dropdown menu.
Keyboard shortcut would improve notebook authoring workflow.

## Proposed behavior

- Add keyboard shortcut (e.g., Cmd+M or Ctrl+M)
- Should work when focus is in notebook
- Should insert cell below current cell

## Context

Similar to Jupyter's 'M' key in command mode. Notebook workflows
frequently alternate between code and markdown cells.
```

**Common anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Unnecessary background or preambles
- Vague descriptions ("it doesn't work", "sometimes crashes")
- Combining multiple unrelated issues
- Apologetic or overly polite language
- Missing concrete details (exact versions, error messages)
- Long-winded explanations when concise ones suffice

**Review checklist before presenting:**
- [ ] Title is complete and specific
- [ ] Body starts with the core issue
- [ ] Reproduction steps are clear (for bugs)
- [ ] System details included (for bugs)
- [ ] Error messages are exact quotes
- [ ] No unnecessary fluff
- [ ] Each sentence adds value
- [ ] Single, focused topic
- [ ] Appropriate labels selected

### 5. Present Draft to User

Show the complete drafted issue including:
- Title
- Full body text
- Proposed labels

Ask user: "Does this accurately capture the issue? Would you like any changes before I create it?"

**Allow for iteration:**
- User may want to adjust wording
- May remember additional details
- May want to emphasize different aspects

Make requested changes and show updated draft.

### 6. Create the Issue

Once user approves, create the issue using GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Create the issue with title, body, and labels
gh issue create \
  --repo posit-dev/positron \
  --title "Issue title here" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Full issue body here
with multiple lines
EOF
)" \
  --label "area: console,Bug"
```

**After creation:**
- Show the user the issue URL
- Confirm issue was created successfully
- Offer to add any additional comments or screenshots if needed

## Important Guidelines

### Duplicate Detection

**Be thorough but not pedantic:**
- Search with multiple keyword combinations
- Check both issues and discussions
- Look at closed items too (might be fixed or wontfix)

**When uncertain:**
- Show user the potentially similar issues
- Ask explicitly: "Is this the same as what you're reporting?"
- Err on the side of creating new issues rather than incorrectly marking as duplicate

### Context Gathering

**Never guess or assume:**
- If version is unclear, ask specifically
- If steps are vague, request clarification
- If error message is paraphrased, ask for exact text

**Be patient with iteration:**
- Users may not have all information immediately
- May need to reproduce issue to get details
- It's better to ask multiple questions than create incomplete issue

### Writing Style

**Optimize for scanability:**
- Busy developers need to quickly understand the issue
- Put most important information first
- Use formatting (headings, lists, code blocks) appropriately

**Respect reader's time:**
- No unnecessary pleasantries beyond "Thanks for reporting"
- No apologetic language
- No marketing-speak or enthusiasm
- Just clear, factual information

**Be precise:**
- Use exact versions, not "latest" or "recent"
- Quote error messages exactly
- Number steps clearly
- State actual behavior, not interpretations

## Special Cases

### Security Issues

If user describes a security vulnerability:
1. **Do NOT create public issue**
2. Inform user: "This appears to be a security issue. Please report it privately to security@posit.co instead of creating a public issue"
3. Do NOT proceed with issue creation

### Documentation Issues

Treat as feature requests but focus on:
- What documentation is missing or incorrect
- Where users would look for this information
- Suggested improvements

Label with `Documentation` type.

### Performance Issues

Use bug report template but emphasize:
- What operation is slow
- How long it takes vs. expected time
- System details including hardware
- Data size or complexity

Label with `Performance` type.

### Multiple Related Issues

If user describes several related but distinct issues:
1. Identify each separate issue
2. Explain to user: "This sounds like 3 separate issues. I'll help create each one individually."
3. Create issues one at a time
4. Cross-reference in issue bodies if related

## Scripts Reference

### `scripts/fetch_labels.sh`

Retrieves all repository labels for categorization.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/fetch_labels.sh          # Human-readable output
./scripts/fetch_labels.sh --json   # JSON output for parsing
```

### `scripts/search_duplicates.sh`

Searches for potential duplicate issues and discussions.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/search_duplicates.sh "search terms"
./scripts/search_duplicates.sh "search terms" --limit 30
```

Returns:
- Matching issues (open and closed)
- Related discussions
- Direct links to review

## References

Load these reference documents when drafting issues:

- **`references/issue_templates.md`** - Templates for bugs, features, and hybrid issues
- **`references/writing_guidelines.md`** - Detailed writing guidance, anti-patterns, examples

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Creating duplicate issues** - Always search first, show results to user
2. **Incomplete information** - Ask questions until all details are gathered
3. **Verbose writing** - Cut all fluff, be direct and specific
4. **Vague titles** - Titles should tell the complete story
5. **Multiple issues in one** - Split into separate, focused issues
6. **Assuming context** - Ask user to confirm unclear details
7. **Skipping labels** - Always fetch and apply appropriate labels
8. **Creating without user approval** - Always show draft and get confirmation

## Success Criteria

A successful issue creation means:
- No duplicates exist (or user confirmed it's distinct)
- All necessary information is included
- Issue is terse and free of fluff
- Title accurately summarizes the issue
- Appropriate labels applied
- User approved the draft
- Issue was successfully created on GitHub

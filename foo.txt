This script will:

- Kill any running build daemons
- Recursively remove any existing 'node_modules' folders
- Remove the '.build' directory
- Remove the 'amalthea' builds
- Rebuild the aforementioned 'node_modules' folders

This will probably take a while, so only run this script if you're stuck and
you need to restart from a fresh slate.

Once this script is done, launch the build tasks using:

- Cmd  + Shift + B (macOS)
- Ctrl + Shift + B (Linux)

from within VSCode.

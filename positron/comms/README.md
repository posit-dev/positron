## Positron Comm Contracts

This directory contains the [OpenRPC](https://open-rpc.org/) contracts for most of Positron's custom comm channels. The RPCs that pass through these channels are delivered as [Jupyter Custom messsages](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/messaging.html#custom-messages).

OpenRPC is designed for straightforward client-server communication, but Positron's comms are bidirectional. For this reason, each comm has a _pair_ of OpenRPC specifications: one defining the comm's **backend** (implemented by the kernel) and one defining the **frontend** (implemented by Positron)

### Structure

Each Positron comm is defined using three files:

#### Comm Metadata: {comm}.json

This file contains metadata about the comm itself rather than the messages delivered on the comm. There are only 3 metadata fields:

| field          | value                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`         | The name of the comm                                                                             |
| `initiator`    | Either `frontend` or `backend`; indicates who opens the comm                                     |
| `initial_data` | A JSON Schema defining the initial data that is expected to be delivered when the comm is opened |

#### Comm Backend: {comm}-backend-openrpc.json

This file contains the interface exposed by the comm's **backend** (kernel). This consists mostly (but not exclusively) of RPC requests and responses.

#### Comm Frontend: {comm}-frontend-openrpc.json

This file contains the interface exposed by the comm's **frontend** (UI).

Because most messages sent to the frontend are events, many methods defined by the frontend contracts do not have a response or reply type. These are [JSON-RPC Notifications](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#notification).

## OpenRPC/JSON-RPC Deviations

JSON-RPC is useful as a standardized specification format, but because we are using it in a slightly off-label way, we've made a few tweaks to suit our use case.

- **The "id" field is not used**. Because the JSON-RPC messages are being delivered as `comm_msg` Jupyter messages, each message already has an ID and a parent ID. This makes the JSON-RPC ID redundant.
- **The "jsonrpc" field is optional**.
- **Parameters are always passed by name**. JSON-RPC allows parameters to be passed either positionally (in a JSON array) or by name (in a JSON object). Currently, we only pass arguments by name.

## Making Changes

If you're making changes to these contracts, you will need to coordinate your change across three different repositories. Here's how to do it:

### Step 1: Set Up Repositories

The code generator presumes that you have the `ark` repository set up as a sibling folder to `positron`. If you haven't already, clone `ark` alongside Positron.

The code generator also places files in `extensions/positron-python`.

### Step 2: Change the Contract

Make your desired changes in the JSON files that define the contract.

### Step 3: Run Code Generator

If you haven't already, move to this folder (`comms`) and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd positron/comms
npm install
```

If you've already installed dependencies, just run the code generator.
This will (re-)generate code for all comms.

```sh
npx ts-node generate-comms.ts
```

If you have `just` installed, then just run `just`:

```sh
just
```

For each contract, this writes Rust, Python, and Typescript modules using the current contract.
It also prints each affected filepath.

You can also limit code generation to one or more specific comms by supplying additional command line arguments.
This will (re-)generate code only for the ui and variables comms.

```
npx ts-node generate-comms.ts ui variables
```

You can pass arguments via `just` as well but you'll need to explicitly name the `gen` recipe instead of relying on it being the default:

```
just gen ui variables
```

Above we've targetted two comms by name, "ui" and "variables".
It's also acceptable to specify a comm by mentioning any member of its trio of files, i.e. "ui.json", "ui-frontend-openrpc.json", and "ui-backend-openrpc.json" are the same as specifying "ui".

If things go sideways, there is a debug configuration called "Run generate-comms.ts" that allows you to set breakpoints in `generate-comms.ts`.
You will probably want to use the "args" field to target the specific comm that's giving you trouble.
Use *Run > Open Configurations* to open `launch.json` and see/edit the configuration.

### Step 4: Test Changes

Build `ark`, restart Positron, and thoroughly test your changes against both R and Python kernels.

### Step 5: Prepare Branches

Create new branches in both repositories (`positron` and `ark`). Commit your changes to each branch.

### Step 6: Merge

Once PRs have been approved on each branch, coordinate a merge of both branches. A convenient way to do this is to include the ark version bump in your `positron` PR, so that all the changes land in Positron at the same time.

>        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>
>    d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

>        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
>        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

>
> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>
> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
>    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
>    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
>    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

>    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>
> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

> ## A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
>
> Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
> Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see [http://www.cwi.nl](http://www.cwi.nl)) in the Netherlands
> as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
> principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
>
> In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
> National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see [http://www.cnri.reston.va.us](http://www.cnri.reston.va.us))
> in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
> software.
>
> In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
> BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
> year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
> Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
> [https://www.python.org/psf/](https://www.python.org/psf/)) was formed, a non-profit organization
> created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
> Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
>
> All Python releases are Open Source (see [http://www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org) for
> the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
> releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
> the various releases.

> (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
>     the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
>     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
>     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
>     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
>
> (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
>     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
>     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
>     is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

> Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's

> a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
>
> b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
>    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
>    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
>    Version); or
>
> c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
>    Contributions.
>
>    This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
>    logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the

>
>    2.4. Subsequent Licenses
>
> No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
> distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
> (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
> under the terms of Section 3.3).
>
> 2.5. Representation

>
> 2.6. Fair Use

> This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
> copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
>
> 2.7. Conditions
>
> Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
> Section 2.1.
>
> 3. Responsibilities
>
>    3.1. Distribution of Source Form
>
> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
> Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
> terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
> of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
> they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
> restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.
>
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
>
> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
>
> a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
>    as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
>    Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
>    reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
>    of distribution to the recipient; and
>
> b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
>    or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
>    the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
>    rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
>
>    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
>
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
> Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
> with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
> Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
> You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
> such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
> their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
> either this License or such Secondary License(s).
>
> 3.4. Notices
>
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
> copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
> of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
> Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
> required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
>
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
>
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
> of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
> warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
> alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
>
> 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
>
>    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
>    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
>    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
>    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
>    they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
>    distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
>    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
>    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
>    understand it.
>
> 5. Termination
>
>    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
>    fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
>    then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
>    are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
>    explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
>    if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
>    reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
>    Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
>    ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
>    some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
>    non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
>    compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
>
>    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
>    infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
>    and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
>    indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
>    all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
>    shall terminate.
>
>    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
>    license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
>    validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
>    termination shall survive termination.
>
> 6. Disclaimer of Warranty
>
>    Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
>    warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
>    without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
>    merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
>    risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
>    Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
>    Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
>    correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
>    License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
>    except under this disclaimer.
>
> 7. Limitation of Liability
>
>    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
>    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
>    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
>    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
>    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
>    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
>    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
>    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
>    party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
>    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
>    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
>
> 8. Litigation
>
>    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
>    a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
>    and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
>    reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
>    prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
>
> 9. Miscellaneous
>
>    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
>    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
>    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
>    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
>    contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
>    this License against a Contributor.
>
> 10. Versions of the License
>
>    10.1. New Versions
>
> Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
> 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
> publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
> distinguishing version number.
>
> 10.2. Effect of New Versions
>
> You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
> the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
> under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
> steward.
>
> 10.3. Modified Versions
>
> If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
> create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
> version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
> references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
> modified license differs from this License).
>
> 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
> If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
> Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
> notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
>
> Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

>
> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

>    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>
> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
>
> Version 2.1, February 1999
>
> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
>
> (This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts

> the version number 2.1.)
>
> Preamble
>
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
> freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
> Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
> free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
>
> This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
> specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
> Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
> can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
> this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
> strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
>
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
> not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
> you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
> for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
> it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
> it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
> these things.
>
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
> distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
> rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
> you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
>
> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
> you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
> code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
> complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
> with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
> it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
>
> We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
> library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
> permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
>
> To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
> there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
> modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
> that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
> author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
> introduced by others.
>
> Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
> any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
> effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
> restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
> any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
> consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
>
> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
> ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
> General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
> is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
> this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
> libraries into non-free programs.
>
> When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
> a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
> combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
> General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
> entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
> Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
> the library.
>
> We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
> does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
> Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
> of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
> are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
> libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
> special circumstances.
>
> For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
> encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
> a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
> allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
> library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
> case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
> software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
>
> In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
> programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
> free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
> non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
> operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
> system.
>
> Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
> users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
> linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
> that program using a modified version of the Library.
>
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
> "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
> former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
> be combined with the library in order to run.
>
> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
>
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
>
> 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
>    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
>    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
>    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
>    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
>
>    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
>    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
>    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
>
>    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
>    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
>    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
>    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
>    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
>    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
>    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
>
>    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
>    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
>    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
>    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
>    and installation of the library.
>
>    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
>    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
>    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
>    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
>    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
>    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
>    and what the program that uses the Library does.
>
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
>    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
>    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
>    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
>    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
>    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
>    Library.
>
>    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
>    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
>    fee.
>
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
>    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
>    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
>    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
>
>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
>
>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
>       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
>
>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
>       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
>
>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
>       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
>       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
>       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
>       in the event an application does not supply such function or
>       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
>       its purpose remains meaningful.
>
>       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
>       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
>       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
>       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
>       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
>       root function must still compute square roots.)
>
>       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
>       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
>       and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
>       themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
>       sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
>       distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
>       on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
>       this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
>       entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
>       it.
>
>       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
>       your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
>       exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
>       collective works based on the Library.
>
>       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
>       with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
>       a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
>       the scope of this License.
>
> 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
>    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
>    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
>    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
>    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
>    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
>    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
>    these notices.
>
>    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
>    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
>    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
>
>    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
>    the Library into a program that is not a library.
>
> 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
>    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
>    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
>    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
>    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
>    medium customarily used for software interchange.
>
>    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
>    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
>    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
>    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
>    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
>
> 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
>    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
>    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
>    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
>    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
>
>    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
>    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
>    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
>    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
>    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
>
>    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
>    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
>    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
>    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
>    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
>    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
>
>    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
>    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
>    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
>    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
>    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
>    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
>
>    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
>    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
>    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
>    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
>
> 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
>    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
>    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
>    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
>    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
>    engineering for debugging such modifications.
>
>    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
>    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
>    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
>    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
>    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
>    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
>    of these things:
>
>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
>       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
>       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
>       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
>       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
>       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
>       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
>       executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
>       that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
>       Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
>       to use the modified definitions.)
>
>    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
>       copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
>       rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
>       will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
>       the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
>       interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
>
>    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
>       least three years, to give the same user the materials
>       specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
>       than the cost of performing this distribution.
>
>    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
>       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
>       specified materials from the same place.
>
>    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
>       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
>
>       For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
>       Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
>       reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
>       the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
>       normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
>       components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
>       which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
>       the executable.
>
>       It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
>       restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
>       accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
>       use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
>       distribute.
>
> 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
>    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
>    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
>    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
>    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
>    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
>
>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
>       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
>       facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
>       Sections above.
>
>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
>       that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
>       where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
>
> 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
>    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
>    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
>    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
>    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
>    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
>    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
>
> 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
>    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
>    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
>    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
>    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
>    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
>    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
>    the Library or works based on it.
>
> 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
>    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
>    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
>    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
>    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
>    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
>    this License.
>
> 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
>    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
>    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
>    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
>    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
>    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
>    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
>    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
>    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
>    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
>    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
>    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
>
>    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
>    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
>    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
>
>    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
>    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
>    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
>    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
>    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
>    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
>    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
>    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
>    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
>    impose that choice.
>
>    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
>    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
>
> 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
>    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
>    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
>    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
>    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
>    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
>    written in the body of this License.
>
> 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
>    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
>    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
>    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
>
>    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
>    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
>    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
>    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
>    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
>    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
>    the Free Software Foundation.
>
> 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
>    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
>    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
>    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
>    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
>    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
>    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
>    and reuse of software generally.
>
>    NO WARRANTY
>
> 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
>     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
>     EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
>     OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
>     KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
>     IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
>     PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
>     LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
>     THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
>
> 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
>     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
>     AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
>     FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
>     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
>     LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
>     RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
>     FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
>     SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
>     DAMAGES.
>
> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
>
> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
>
> If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
> everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
> redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
> ordinary General Public License).
>
> To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
> safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
> convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
> "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

>
> Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1
>
> 1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
>    royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the
>    following:
>
>    a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
>
>    b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original

>    Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
>    Original Work and Derivative Works.
>
> 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
>    form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
>    documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
>    agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original

>    such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
>    interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
>    License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
>    license.
>
> 5) This section intentionally omitted.
>
> 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
>    Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
>    Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
>    descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
>    the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
>    Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
>    modified the Original Work.
>
> 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
>    the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
>    by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
>    of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
>    and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
>    sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
>    and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
>    the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
>    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
>    This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
>    license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.
>
> 8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
>    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
>    Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
>    or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
>    or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
>    of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>    other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
>    apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
>    negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
>    jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
>    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
>
> 9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
>    a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
>    obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
>    else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
>    grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
>    or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
>    to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
>    between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
>    equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
>    exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
>    Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.
>
> 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
>    and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
>    as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
>    against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
>    patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
>    patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or
>    hardware.
>
> 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
>    License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
>    Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
>    the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
>    application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
>    Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
>    scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
>    requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et
>    seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
>    section shall survive the termination of this License.
>
> 12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
>    seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
>    recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
>    attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
>    any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
>    License.
>
> 13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
>    the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
>    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
>    make it enforceable.
>
> 14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
>    in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
>    under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
>    entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
>    under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i)
>    the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
>    entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
>    (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
>    entity.
>
> 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
>    restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
>    to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

>    Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed

>
> d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the

>    agreements.
>
> e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
>    any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
>    that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

> h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
>    under this Public License.
>
>    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
>       process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
>       as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
>       dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
>       available to the public including in ways that members of the
>       public may access the material from a place and at a time
>       individually chosen by them.
>
> j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
>    resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of

>    equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
>
> k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights

>    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
>       the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
>       non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
>       exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
>
>       i. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
>          in part; and
>
>       ii. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
>
>    2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where

>       its terms and conditions.
>
>    3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
>       6(a).
>
>    4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
>       Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
>       all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,

>       Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
>       authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
>       necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
>       technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
>       Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
>       simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4)
>       never produces Adapted Material.
>
>    5. Downstream recipients.
>
>       i. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
>          recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
>          receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
>          Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
>          Public License.
>
>       ii. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
>          any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
>          apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
>          Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
>          Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
>          Material.
>
>    6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
>       may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
>       are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
>       with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
>       the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
>       provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
>
> b. Other rights.
>
>    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
>       licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
>       privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
>       the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
>       assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
>       extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
>       Rights, but not otherwise.
>
>    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
>       Public License.
>
>    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
>       collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
>       Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
>       under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
>       licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
>       reserves any right to collect such royalties.
>
> Section 3 -- License Conditions.
>
> Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
> following conditions.
>
> a. Attribution.
>
>    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
>       form), You must:
>
> a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
>    with the Licensed Material:
>
>    i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
>       Material and any others designated to receive
>       attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
>       the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
>       designated);
>
>    ii. a copyright notice;
>
>    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
>
>    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
>       warranties;
>
>    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
>       extent reasonably practicable;
>
> b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
>    retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
>
> c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
>    Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
>    hyperlink to, this Public License.
>
>    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
>       reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
>       which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
>       reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
>       hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
>       information.
>
>    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
>       information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
>       reasonably practicable.
>
>    4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
>       License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
>       Material from complying with this Public License.
>
> Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
>
> Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
> apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
>
> a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
>    to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
>    portion of the contents of the database;
>
> b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
>    contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
>    Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
>    Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
>
> c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
>    all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
>
>    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
>    replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
>    Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
>
>    Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
>
> a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
>    EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
>    AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
>    ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
>    IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
>    WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
>    PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
>    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
>    KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
>    ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
>
> b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
>    TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
>    NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
>    INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
>    COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
>    USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
>    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
>    DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
>    IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
>
> c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
>    above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
>    possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
>    waiver of all liability.
>
>    Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
>
> a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
>    Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
>    this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
>    terminate automatically.
>
> b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
>    Section 6(a), it reinstates:
>
>    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
>       it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
>       violation; or
>
>    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
>
>       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
>       right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
>       of this Public License.
>
> c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
>    Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
>    distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
>    will not terminate this Public License.
>
> d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
>    License.
>
>    Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
>
> a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
>    terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
>
> b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
>    Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
>    independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
>
>    Section 8 -- Interpretation.
>
> a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
>    shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
>    conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
>    be made without permission under this Public License.
>
> b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
>    deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
>    minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
>    cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
>    without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
>    conditions.
>
> c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
>    failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
>    Licensor.
>
> d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
>    as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
>    that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
>    processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

>    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
>    as of the date such litigation is filed.

>        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

>
> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>
> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

>    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>
> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>        the Derivative Works; and
>
>    d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

>        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

>    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

>    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

**Python License version 2.0 text:**

> ## A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
>
> Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
> Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see [http://www.cwi.nl](http://www.cwi.nl)) in the Netherlands
> as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
> principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
>
> In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
> National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see [http://www.cnri.reston.va.us](http://www.cnri.reston.va.us))
> in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
> software.
>
> In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
> BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
> year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
> Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
> [https://www.python.org/psf/](https://www.python.org/psf/)) was formed, a non-profit organization
> created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
> Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
>
> All Python releases are Open Source (see [http://www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org) for
> the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
> releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
> the various releases.
>
> ```

>
> Footnotes:
>
> (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
>     the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
>     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
>     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
>     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
>
> (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
>     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
>     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
>     is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
>
> Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
> direction to make these releases possible.

>    as of the date such litigation is filed.

>        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
>        the Derivative Works; and
>
>    d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
>        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

>        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
>        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
>        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

>        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>        the conditions stated in this License.
>
> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

>    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>
> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
>
>    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

> Contributor:
>
> a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
>     or
>

>
> 2.4. Subsequent Licenses

> ### 3. Responsibilities
>
> 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
>
> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
> Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
> the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
> Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
> License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
> attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
> Form.
>
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
>
> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
>
> a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
>     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
>     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
>     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
>     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
>
> b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
>     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
>     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
>     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
>
> 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
>
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
> the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
> Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
> Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
> License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
> under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
> the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
> Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
> License(s).
>
> 3.4. Notices
>
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
> (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
> or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
> the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
> the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
>
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
>
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
> behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
> such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
> You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
>
> ### 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
>
> If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
> License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
> statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
> the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
> describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
> be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
> Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
> or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
> recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
>
> ### 5. Termination
>
> 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
> if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
> compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
> Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
> ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
> non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
> come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
> notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
> first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
> from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
> Your receipt of the notice.
>
> 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
> infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
> counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
> directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
> You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
> 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
>
> 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
> end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
> have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
> prior to termination shall survive termination.
>
> ---
>
> ### **6. Disclaimer of Warranty**
>
> **Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"**
> **basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or**
> **statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the**
> **Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a**
> **particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the**
> **quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.**
> **Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You**
> **(not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,**
> **repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an**
> **essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is**
> **authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.**
>
> ---
>
> ---
>
> ### **7. Limitation of Liability**
>
> **Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort**
> **(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any**
> **Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as**
> **permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,**
> **special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character**
> **including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of**
> **goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any**
> **and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party**
> **shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This**
> **limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or**
> **personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the**
> **extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some**
> **jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of**
> **incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and**
> **limitation may not apply to You.**
>
> ---
>
> ### 8. Litigation
>
> Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
> courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
> place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
> jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
> Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
> cross-claims or counter-claims.
>
> ### 9. Miscellaneous
>
> This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
> matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
> unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
> necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
> that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
> shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
>
> ### 10. Versions of the License
>
> 10.1. New Versions
>
> Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
> 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
> publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
> distinguishing version number.
>
> 10.2. Effect of New Versions
>
> You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
> of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
> or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
> steward.
>
> 10.3. Modified Versions
>
> If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
> create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
> modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
> any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
> such modified license differs from this License).
>
> 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
> Licenses
>
> If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
> Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
> notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
>
> ### Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

>       exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

>       i. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or

>          Public License.
>
>       ii. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
>          any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
>          apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
>          Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
>          Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
>          Material.
>
>    6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
>       may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You

>       with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
>       the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
>       provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
>
> b. Other rights.
>
>    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
>       licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
>       privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
>       the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
>       assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
>       extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
>       Rights, but not otherwise.
>
>    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
>       Public License.
>
>    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
>       collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
>       Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
>       under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
>       licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
>       reserves any right to collect such royalties.
>
> Section 3 -- License Conditions.
>
> Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
> following conditions.
>
> a. Attribution.
>
>    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
>       form), You must:
>
> a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
>    with the Licensed Material:
>
>    i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
>       Material and any others designated to receive
>       attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
>       the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
>       designated);
>
>    ii. a copyright notice;
>
>    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
>
>    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
>       warranties;
>
>    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the

>
>    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
>       reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
>       which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
>       reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
>       hyperlink to a resource that includes the required

>
>    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
>       information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
>       reasonably practicable.
>
>    4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
>       License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
>       Material from complying with this Public License.
>
> Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
>
> Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
> apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
>
> a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
>    to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
>    portion of the contents of the database;
>
> b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
>    contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
>    Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
>    Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
>
> c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
>    all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

>    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
>    as of the date such litigation is filed.

>    d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

>        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
>        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
>        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
>        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>
> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
>
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
> Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
> with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
> Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
> You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
> such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
> their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
> either this License or such Secondary License(s).
>
> 3.4. Notices
>
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
> copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
> of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
> Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
> required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
>
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
>
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
> of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
> warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
> alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
>
> 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
>
>    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
>    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
>    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
>    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
>    they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
>    distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
>    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
>    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
>    understand it.
>
> 5. Termination
>
>    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
>    fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
>    then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
>    are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
>    explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
>    if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
>    reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
>    Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
>    ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
>    some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
>    non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
>    compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
>
>    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
>    infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
>    and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
>    indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
>    all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
>    shall terminate.
>
>    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
>    license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
>    validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
>    termination shall survive termination.
>
> 6. Disclaimer of Warranty
>
>    Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
>    warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
>    without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
>    merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
>    risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
>    Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
>    Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
>    correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
>    License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
>    except under this disclaimer.
>
> 7. Limitation of Liability
>
>    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
>    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
>    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
>    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
>    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
>    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
>    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
>    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
>    party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
>    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
>    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
>
> 8. Litigation
>
>    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
>    a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
>    and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
>    reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
>    prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
>
> 9. Miscellaneous
>
>    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
>    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
>    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
>    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
>    contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
>    this License against a Contributor.
>
> 10. Versions of the License
>
>    10.1. New Versions
>
> Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
> 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
> publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
> distinguishing version number.
>
> 10.2. Effect of New Versions
>
> You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
> the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
> under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
> steward.
>
> 10.3. Modified Versions
>
> If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
> create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
> version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
> references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
> modified license differs from this License).
>
> 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
> If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
> Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
> notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
>
> Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

>
> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
> Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
> the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
> Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
> License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
> attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
> Form.
>
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
>
> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
>
> a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
>     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
>     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
>     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
>     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
>
> b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
>     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
>     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
>     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
>
> 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
>
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
> the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
> Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
> Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
> License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
> under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
> the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
> Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
> License(s).
>
> 3.4. Notices
>
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
> (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
> or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
> the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
> the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
>
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
>
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
> behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
> such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
> You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
>
> ### 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
>
> If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
> License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
> statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
> the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
> describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
> be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
> Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
> or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
> recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
>
> ### 5. Termination
>
> 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
> if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
> compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
> Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
> ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
> non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
> come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
> notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
> first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
> from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
> Your receipt of the notice.
>
> 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
> infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
> counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
> directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
> You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
> 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
>
> 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
> end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
> have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
> prior to termination shall survive termination.
>
> ---
>
> ### **6. Disclaimer of Warranty**
>
> **Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"**
> **basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or**
> **statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the**
> **Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a**
> **particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the**
> **quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.**
> **Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You**
> **(not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,**
> **repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an**
> **essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is**
> **authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.**
>
> ---
>
> ---
>
> ### **7. Limitation of Liability**
>
> **Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort**
> **(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any**
> **Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as**
> **permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,**
> **special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character**
> **including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of**
> **goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any**
> **and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party**
> **shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This**
> **limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or**
> **personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the**
> **extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some**
> **jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of**
> **incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and**
> **limitation may not apply to You.**
>
> ---
>
> ### 8. Litigation
>
> Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
> courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
> place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
> jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
> Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
> cross-claims or counter-claims.
>
> ### 9. Miscellaneous
>
> This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
> matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
> unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
> necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
> that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
> shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>
> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
>
>    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

>
> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

>    d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

>        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

>        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>        the conditions stated in this License.
>
> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>
> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

>    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
>
> 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

>    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
>    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>
> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
>
>    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
>
> Version 2.1, February 1999
>
> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

> (This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts

> the version number 2.1.)
>
> Preamble
>
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
> freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
> Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
> free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
>
> This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
> specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
> Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
> can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
> this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
> strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
>
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
> not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
> you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
> for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
> it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
> it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
> these things.
>
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
> distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
> rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
> you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
>
> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
> you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
> code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
> complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
> with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
> it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
>
> We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
> library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
> permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
>
> To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
> there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
> modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
> that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
> author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
> introduced by others.
>
> Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
> any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
> effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
> restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
> any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
> consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
>
> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
> ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
> General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
> is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
> this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
> libraries into non-free programs.
>
> When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
> a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
> combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
> General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the

>
> We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
> does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
> Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
> of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
> are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
> libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
> special circumstances.
>
> For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
> encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
> a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
> allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
> library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
> case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
> software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
>
> In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
> programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
> free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
> non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
> operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
> system.
>
> Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
> users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
> linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
> that program using a modified version of the Library.
>
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
> "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
> former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
> be combined with the library in order to run.

> GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
>
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
>
> 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
>    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
>    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
>    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
>    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
>
>    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
>    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
>    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
>
>    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
>    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
>    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
>    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
>    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
>    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
>    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
>
>    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
>    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
>    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
>    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
>    and installation of the library.
>
>    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
>    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
>    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
>    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
>    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
>    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
>    and what the program that uses the Library does.
>
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
>    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
>    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
>    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
>    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
>    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
>    Library.
>
>    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
>    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
>    fee.
>
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
>    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
>    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
>    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
>
>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
>
>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
>       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
>
>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
>       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
>
>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
>       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
>       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
>       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
>       in the event an application does not supply such function or
>       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
>       its purpose remains meaningful.
>
>       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
>       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
>       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
>       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
>       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
>       root function must still compute square roots.)
>
>       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
>       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
>       and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
>       themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
>       sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
>       distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
>       on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
>       this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
>       entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
>       it.
>
>       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
>       your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
>       exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
>       collective works based on the Library.
>
>       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
>       with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
>       a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
>       the scope of this License.
>
> 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
>    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
>    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
>    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
>    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
>    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
>    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
>    these notices.
>
>    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
>    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
>    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
>
>    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
>    the Library into a program that is not a library.
>
> 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
>    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
>    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
>    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
>    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
>    medium customarily used for software interchange.
>
>    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
>    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
>    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
>    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
>    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
>
> 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
>    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
>    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
>    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
>    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
>
>    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
>    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
>    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
>    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
>    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
>
>    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
>    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
>    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
>    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
>    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
>    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
>
>    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
>    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
>    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
>    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
>    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
>    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
>
>    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
>    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
>    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
>    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
>
> 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
>    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
>    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
>    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
>    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
>    engineering for debugging such modifications.
>
>    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
>    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
>    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
>    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
>    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
>    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
>    of these things:
>
>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
>       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
>       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
>       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
>       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
>       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
>       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
>       executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
>       that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
>       Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
>       to use the modified definitions.)
>
>    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
>       copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
>       rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
>       will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
>       the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
>       interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
>
>    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
>       least three years, to give the same user the materials
>       specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
>       than the cost of performing this distribution.
>
>    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
>       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
>       specified materials from the same place.
>
>    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
>       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
>
>       For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
>       Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
>       reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
>       the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
>       normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
>       components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
>       which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
>       the executable.
>
>       It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
>       restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
>       accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
>       use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
>       distribute.
>
> 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
>    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
>    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
>    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
>    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
>    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
>
>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
>       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
>       facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
>       Sections above.
>
>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
>       that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
>       where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
>
> 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
>    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
>    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
>    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
>    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
>    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
>    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
>
> 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
>    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
>    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
>    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
>    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
>    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
>    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
>    the Library or works based on it.
>
> 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
>    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
>    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
>    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
>    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
>    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
>    this License.
>
> 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
>    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
>    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
>    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
>    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
>    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
>    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
>    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
>    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
>    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
>    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
>    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
>
>    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
>    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
>    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
>
>    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
>    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
>    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
>    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
>    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
>    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
>    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
>    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
>    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
>    impose that choice.
>
>    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
>    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
>
> 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
>    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
>    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
>    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
>    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
>    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
>    written in the body of this License.
>
> 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
>    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
>    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
>    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
>
>    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
>    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
>    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
>    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
>    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
>    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
>    the Free Software Foundation.
>
> 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
>    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
>    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
>    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
>    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
>    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
>    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
>    and reuse of software generally.
>
>    NO WARRANTY
>
> 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
>     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
>     EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
>     OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
>     KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
>     IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
>     PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
>     LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
>     THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
>
> 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
>     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
>     AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
>     FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
>     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
>     LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
>     RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
>     FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
>     SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
>     DAMAGES.
>
> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
>
> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
>
> If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
> everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
> redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
> ordinary General Public License).
>
> To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
> safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
> convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
> "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

>
>    e) to display the Original Work publicly.
>
> 2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
>    royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
>    claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
>    Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
>    Original Work and Derivative Works.
>
> 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
>    form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
>    documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
>    agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
>    Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
>    Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
>    machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
>    reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as
>    long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
>    the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following
>    the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
>
> 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
>    of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
>    service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
>    Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
>    in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
>    patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
>    expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
>    offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
>    defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
>    such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
>    interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
>    License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
>    license.
>
> 5) This section intentionally omitted.
>
> 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
>    Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
>    Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
>    descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
>    the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
>    Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
>    modified the Original Work.
>
> 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
>    the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
>    by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
>    of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
>    and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
>    sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
>    and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
>    the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
>    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
>    This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
>    license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.
>
> 8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
>    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
>    Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
>    or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
>    or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
>    of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>    other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
>    apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
>    negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
>    jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
>    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
>
> 9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
>    a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
>    obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
>    else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
>    grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
>    or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
>    to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
>    between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
>    equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
>    exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
>    Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.
>
> 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
>    and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
>    as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
>    against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
>    patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
>    patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or
>    hardware.
>
> 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
>    License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
>    Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
>    the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
>    application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
>    Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
>    scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
>    requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et
>    seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
>    section shall survive the termination of this License.
>
> 12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
>    seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
>    recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
>    attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
>    any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
>    License.
>
> 13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
>    the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
>    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
>    make it enforceable.
>
> 14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
>    in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
>    under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
>    entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
>    under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i)
>    the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
>    entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
>    (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
>    entity.
>
> 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
>    restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
>    to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

> &lt;<beginOptional;name=ccOptionalIntro&gt;> CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.  &lt;<endOptional&gt;>
>
> Statement of Purpose
>
> The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
>
> Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
>
> For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
>
> 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
>
>    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
>
>    ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
>
>    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
>
>    iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
>
>    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
>
>    vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
>
>    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
>
> 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
>
> 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
>
> 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
>
>    a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
>
>    b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
>
>    c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
>
>    d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

>    d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

>        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
>        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

>
> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>
> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
>    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
>    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
>    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
>
> 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
>    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
>    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

>    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>
> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
>
>    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

> ### 3. Responsibilities
>
> 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
>
> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
> Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
> the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
> Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
> License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
> attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
> Form.
>
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
>
> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
>
> a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
>     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
>     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
>     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
>     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
>
> b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
>     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
>     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
>     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
>
> 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
>
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
> the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
> Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
> Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
> License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
> under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
> the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
> Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
> License(s).
>
> 3.4. Notices
>
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
> (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
> or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
> the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
> the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
>
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
>
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
> behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
> such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
> You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
>
> ### 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
>
> If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
> License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
> statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
> the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
> describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
> be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
> Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
> or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
> recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
>
> ### 5. Termination
>
> 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
> if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
> compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
> Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
> ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
> non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
> come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
> notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
> first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
> from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
> Your receipt of the notice.
>
> 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
> infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
> counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
> directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
> You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
> 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
>
> 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
> end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
> have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
> prior to termination shall survive termination.
>
> ---

> ### **6. Disclaimer of Warranty**
>
> **Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"**
> **basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or**
> **statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the**
> **Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a**

> **essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is**
> **authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.**

>    as of the date such litigation is filed.

>    d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

>        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>
> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

>    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>
> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
>
>    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

>
> ### 3. Responsibilities
>
> 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
>
> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
> Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
> the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
> Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
> License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
> attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
> Form.
>
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
>
> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
>
> a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
>     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
>     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
>     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
>     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
>
> b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
>     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
>     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
>     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
>
> 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
>
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
> the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
> Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
> Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
> License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
> under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
> the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
> Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
> License(s).
>
> 3.4. Notices
>
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
> (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
> or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
> the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
> the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
>
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
>
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
> behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
> such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
> You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
>
> ### 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
>
> If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
> License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
> statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
> the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
> describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
> be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
> Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
> or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
> recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
>
> ### 5. Termination
>
> 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
> if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
> compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
> Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
> ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
> non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
> come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
> notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
> first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
> from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
> Your receipt of the notice.
>
> 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
> infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
> counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
> directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
> You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
> 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
>
> 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
> end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
> have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
> prior to termination shall survive termination.
>
> ---
>
> ### **6. Disclaimer of Warranty**
>
> **Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"**
> **basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or**
> **statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the**
> **Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a**
> **particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the**
> **quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.**
> **Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You**
> **(not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,**
> **repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an**
> **essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is**
> **authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.**
>
> ---
>
> ---
>
> ### **7. Limitation of Liability**
>
> **Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort**
> **(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any**
> **Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as**
> **permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,**
> **special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character**
> **including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of**
> **goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any**
> **and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party**
> **shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This**
> **limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or**
> **personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the**
> **extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some**
> **jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of**
> **incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and**
> **limitation may not apply to You.**
>
> ---
>
> ### 8. Litigation
>
> Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
> courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
> place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
> jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
> Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
> cross-claims or counter-claims.
>
> ### 9. Miscellaneous
>
> This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
> matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
> unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
> necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
> that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
> shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
>
> ### 10. Versions of the License
>
> 10.1. New Versions
>
> Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
> 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
> publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
> distinguishing version number.
>
> 10.2. Effect of New Versions
>
> You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
> of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
> or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
> steward.
>
> 10.3. Modified Versions
>
> If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
> create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
> modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
> any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
> such modified license differs from this License).
>
> 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
> Licenses
>
> If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
> Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
> notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
>
> ### Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
>

> License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
> file, You can obtain one at [http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.](http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.)

> file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
> file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
> for such a notice.
>
> You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
>
> ### Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice
>

> ### 3. Responsibilities
>
> 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
>
> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
> Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
> the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
> Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
> License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
> attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
> Form.
>
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
>
> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
>
> a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
>     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
>     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
>     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
>     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
>
> b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
>     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
>     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
>     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
>
> 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
>
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
> the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
> Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
> Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
> License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
> under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
> the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
> Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
> License(s).
>
> 3.4. Notices
>
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
> (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
> or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
> the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
> the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
>
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
>
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
> behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
> such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
> You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
>
> ### 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
>
> If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
> License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
> statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
> the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
> describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
> be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
> Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
> or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
> recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
>
> ### 5. Termination
>
> 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
> if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
> compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
> Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
> ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
> non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
> come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
> notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
> first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
> from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
> Your receipt of the notice.
>
> 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
> infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
> counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
> directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
> You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
> 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
>
> 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
> end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
> have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
> prior to termination shall survive termination.
>
> ---
>
> ### **6. Disclaimer of Warranty**
>
> **Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"**
> **basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or**
> **statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the**
> **Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a**
> **particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the**
> **quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.**
> **Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You**
> **(not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,**
> **repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an**
> **essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is**
> **authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.**
>
> ---
>
> ---
>
> ### **7. Limitation of Liability**
>
> **Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort**
> **(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any**
> **Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as**
> **permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,**
> **special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character**
> **including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of**
> **goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any**
> **and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party**
> **shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This**
> **limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or**
> **personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the**
> **extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some**
> **jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of**
> **incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and**
> **limitation may not apply to You.**
>
> ---
>
> ### 8. Litigation
>
> Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
> courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
> place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
> jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
> Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
> cross-claims or counter-claims.
>
> ### 9. Miscellaneous
>
> This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
> matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
> unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
> necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
> that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
> shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
>
> ### 10. Versions of the License
>
> 10.1. New Versions
>
> Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
> 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
> publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
> distinguishing version number.
>
> 10.2. Effect of New Versions
>
> You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
> of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
> or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
> steward.
>
> 10.3. Modified Versions
>
> If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
> create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
> modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
> any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
> such modified license differs from this License).
>
> 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
> Licenses
>
> If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
> Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
> notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
>

> Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
> Contributor:
>
> a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
>     or
>
> b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
>     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
>     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
>     Version); or
>
> c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
>     its Contributions.
>
>     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
>     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with

>
> 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
>

> permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
>
> 2.5. Representation

> Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
> to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

> ### 3. Responsibilities
>
> 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
>
> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
> Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
> the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
> Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
> License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
> attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
> Form.
>
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
>
> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
>
> a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
>     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
>     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
>     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
>     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
>
> b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
>     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
>     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
>     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
>
> 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
>
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
> the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
> Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
> Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
> License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
> under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
> the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
> Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
> License(s).
>
> 3.4. Notices
>
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
> (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
> or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
> the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
> the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
>
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
>
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
> behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
> such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
> You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
>
> ### 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
>
> If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
> License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
> statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
> the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
> describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
> be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
> Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
> or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
> recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
>
> ### 5. Termination
>
> 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
> if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
> compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
> Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
> ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
> non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
> come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
> notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
> first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
> from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
> Your receipt of the notice.
>
> 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
> infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
> counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
> directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
> You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
> 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
>
> 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
> end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
> have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
> prior to termination shall survive termination.
>
> ---
>
> ### **6. Disclaimer of Warranty**
>
> **Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"**
> **basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or**
> **statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the**
> **Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a**
> **particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the**
> **quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.**
> **Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You**
> **(not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,**
> **repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an**
> **essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is**
> **authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.**
>
> ---
>
> ---
>
> ### **7. Limitation of Liability**
>
> **Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort**
> **(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any**
> **Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as**
> **permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,**
> **special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character**
> **including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of**
> **goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any**
> **and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party**
> **shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This**
> **limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or**
> **personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the**
> **extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some**
> **jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of**
> **incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and**
> **limitation may not apply to You.**
>
> ---
>
> ### 8. Litigation
>
> Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
> courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
> place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
> jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
> Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
> cross-claims or counter-claims.
>
> ### 9. Miscellaneous
>
> This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
> matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
> unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
> necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
> that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
> shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
>
> ### 10. Versions of the License
>
> 10.1. New Versions
>
> Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
> 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
> publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
> distinguishing version number.
>
> 10.2. Effect of New Versions
>
> You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
> of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
> or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
> steward.
>
> 10.3. Modified Versions
>
> If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
> create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
> modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
> any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
> such modified license differs from this License).
>
> 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
> Licenses
>
> If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
> Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
> notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.&#10;&#10;Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;ccLicensed&quot;;original&#61;&quot;&quot;;match&#61;&quot;CC-[ \t\r\n\f]{0,10}licensed&quot;&gt;&gt; material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright.

If the licensor&#39;s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described.&#10;&#10;Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;spaceUnderscore&quot;;original&#61;&quot;More considerations&quot;;match&#61;&quot;More considerations|More_considerations&quot;&gt;&gt; for the public &lt;&lt;var;name&#61;&quot;considerationsLicensees&quot;;original&#61;&quot;: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees&quot;;match&#61;&quot;:[ \t\r\n\f]{1,10}wiki\.creativecommons\.org/Considerations_for_licensees|\.&quot;&gt;&gt;&#10;&#10;Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License&#10;&#10;By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public License&quot;).

>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>
> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>       exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
>
>       i. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
>          in part; and

>          Public License.
>
>       ii. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
>          any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
>          apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
>          Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
>          Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
>          Material.
>
>    6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
>       may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
>       are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
>       with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
>       the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as

>    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any

>       which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
>       reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
>       hyperlink to a resource that includes the required

>
>    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
>       information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent

>
>    4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
>       License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
>       Material from complying with this Public License.
>
> Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
>
> Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
> apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
>
> a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
>    to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
>    portion of the contents of the database;
>
> b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
>    contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
>    Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
>    Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
>
> c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
>    all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
>
>    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not

> a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
>    EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
>    AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
>    ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,

>    PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
>    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT

>
> c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
>    above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
>    possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
>    waiver of all liability.
>
>    Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
>
> a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
>    Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
>    this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
>    terminate automatically.
>
> b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
>    Section 6(a), it reinstates:
>
>    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
>       it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
>       violation; or
>
>    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
>
>       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
>       right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
>       of this Public License.
>
> c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
>    Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
>    distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
>    will not terminate this Public License.
>
> d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
>    License.
>
>    Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
>
> a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
>    terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
>
> b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
>    Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
>    independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
>
>    Section 8 -- Interpretation.
>
> a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
>    shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
>    conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
>    be made without permission under this Public License.
>
> b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
>    deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
>    minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
>    cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
>    without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
>    conditions.
>
> c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
>    failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
>    Licensor.
>
> d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
>    as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
>    that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
>    processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

>    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
>    meet the following conditions:
>
>    a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
>        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
>
>    b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
>        stating that You changed the files; and
>
>    c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
>        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
>        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
>        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
>        the Derivative Works; and
>
>    d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
>        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
>        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
>        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
>        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
>        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
>        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
>        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
>        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
>        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
>        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
>        as modifying the License.
>
>        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
>        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
>        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
>        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
>        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>        the conditions stated in this License.
>
> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
>
> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
>    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
>    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
>    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
>
> 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
>    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
>    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

>    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
>    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
>    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
>
> 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
>    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
>    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
>    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
>    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
>
> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

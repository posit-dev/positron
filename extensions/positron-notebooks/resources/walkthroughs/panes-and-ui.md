Positron provides a powerful environment for working with notebooks, with integrated panes designed for data science workflows:

- The [Help pane](command:workbench.panel.positronHelp.focus) provides documentation lookups for Python objects and packages.
- Manage database connections and preview tables in the [Connections pane](command:workbench.panel.positronConnections.focus).
- The [Variables pane](command:positronVariables.focus) lets you inspect and explore variables in your current notebook session, including dataframes, arrays, and other objects.
- Click on a dataframe in the Variables pane to open it in the **Data Explorer**, where you can sort, filter, and explore your data interactively.

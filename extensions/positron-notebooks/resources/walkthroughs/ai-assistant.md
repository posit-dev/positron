Unlike general purpose AI, Positron Assistant understands which cells you've run and in what order, what variables exist in memory, your execution history, and errors.

- Ask questions about your code, get help understanding errors, or request explanations of complex concepts.
- Positron Assistant can help you write new code, refactor existing code, or explore data analysis approaches.
- Use AI quick actions to explain, fix, or improve your notebook.

The AI assistant is context-aware and can see your notebook's code and outputs, making it a powerful tool for interactive data science workflows.

Ensure you have the [Assistant enabled](https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html)

[Open the Assistant panel](command:workbench.action.chat.open) to configure your model provider and start a conversation with the AI assistant.

Prefer to code without AI? You can always [disable the Assistant](https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html)

Unlike general-purpose AI assistants, Positron Assistant is specifically designed for data science workflows. It understands your notebook's execution context, including which cells you've run, what variables exist in memory, your execution history, and any errors you've encountered.

## What Assistant can do

- **Context-aware conversations** - Ask questions about your data, get help understanding errors and more.
- **Code generation and refactoring** - Get help writing new analysis code, refactoring existing notebooks, or exploring alternative data analysis approaches.
- **Smart quick actions** - Use AI-powered actions to explain code blocks, fix errors, or suggest improvements to your analysis.

## Getting Started

The AI assistant can see your notebook's code, outputs, and variable states, making it uniquely powerful for interactive data science workflows.

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the [Assistant enabled and configured](https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html) with your preferred model provider.

**Try it now:** [Open the Assistant panel](command:workbench.action.chat.open) to configure your model provider and start an AI-assisted data science conversation.

**Work without AI** You can always [disable the Assistant](https://positron.posit.co/assistant-getting-started.html) if you prefer to code without AI assistance.

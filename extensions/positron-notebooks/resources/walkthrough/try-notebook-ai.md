Unlike general purpose AI, Positron Assistant understands which cells you've run and in what order, what variables exist in memory, your execution history and errors.

## Give it a try:

### 1. Run some cells

Run a few cells in the demo notebook to create some variables and outputs.

### 2. Open Positron Assistant

[Open Positron Assistant](command:workbench.action.chat.openEditSession) and ask it questions about the notebook.

<!-- Image placeholder: Positron Assistant showing notebook context -->

Try asking:
- "What dataframes do I have in memory?"
- "Explain what the last cell did"
- "How can I filter this dataset?"
- "Why did I get this error?"

The assistant can see your execution history and variable state, making its suggestions contextually relevant.

### 3. Use AI Quick Actions

In the Positron Notebook navigation bar, click on the [AI assistant button](command:positronNotebook.askAssistant) to explore the prompt gallery of static and dynamic AI quick actions.

Many of the keybindings you are familiar with from RStudio are available by default in Positron. For example, you can:

- Use <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the current R statement (or selection) in the Console.
- Restart R with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd>.
- Insert a pipe with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>.

Some RStudio keybindings are not available by default, but you can [opt in to them using a setting](command:r.walkthrough.updateRStudioKeybindings). If you opt in, you can then:

- Focus the Source Editor with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> and focus the Console with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd>.
- Comment or uncomment the current line with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
- Create a new R file with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>.

Opting in to this setting will overwrite some of Positronâ€™s default keybindings, so you might then also prefer to change or remove some of these newly enabled keybindings.

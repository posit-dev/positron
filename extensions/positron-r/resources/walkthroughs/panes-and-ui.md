Positron has many UI elements that are similar to RStudio and will feel familiar to you:

- Run code interactively in the [Console](command:workbench.action.positronConsole.focusConsole).
- Use the [File Explorer](command:workbench.files.action.focusFilesExplorer) to navigate your files.
- Use the [Outline](command:outline.focus) to see the structure of your R and other files, including code cells, functions, variables, and more.
- Use the [Variables pane](command:positronVariables.focus) to interactively explore the variables you have defined in your R session.
- The [Plots pane](command:workbench.panel.positronPlots.focus) shows you the plots you have created in your R session.
- The [Help pane](command:workbench.panel.positronHelp.focus) provides access to R documentation, including help pages and vignettes.
- Manage database connections in the [Connections pane](command:workbench.panel.positronConnections.focus).
- Use the [Terminal](command:workbench.action.terminal.focus) to run shell commands.

Positron has fewer buttons and icons than RStudio, so you will likely find yourself using the Command Palette more often. You can open the Command Palette with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>. Then type the name of the command you want to run, such as "Focus Console" or "New Terminal". You can also use the Command Palette to search for commands by typing a keyword, such as "format" to find formatting commands.

The layout of Positron is also much more customizable than RStudio. You can drag and drop panes to rearrange them, or you can use the Command Palette to run commands like "View: Toggle Primary Side Bar Visibility" or "View: Toggle Top Bar Visibility". Positron provides several layout presets appropriate for data science; [customize your layout](command:workbench.action.customizeLayout) to try out the Stacked, Side-by-Side, and Notebook layouts.

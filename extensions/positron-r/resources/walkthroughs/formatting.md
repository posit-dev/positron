Positron bundles Air, an R formatter and language server, to provide formatting for your R code. You can use Air from the command line to format files or projects, but you can also use it interactively in Positron.

- You can format your current file or selection from the command palette with "Format Document" or "Format Selection".
- You can configure Air to automatically format your code when you save a file by [enabling the setting "Format On Save"](command:r.walkthrough.airFormatOnSave).

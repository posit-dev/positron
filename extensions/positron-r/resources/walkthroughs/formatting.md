Positron bundles Air, an R formatter and language server, to provide formatting for your R code in both `.R`, `.Rmd`, and `.qmd` files. You can use Air from the command line to format files or projects, but you can also use it interactively in Positron.

- You can format your current file or selection from the command palette with "Format Document" or "Format Selection".
- You can configure Air to automatically format your R code when you save a file by [enabling the setting "Format On Save"](command:r.walkthrough.formatOnSave).

We recommend that you opt in to using Air to format every time you save a file; you'll benefit from consistent formatting across your code, including adding final newlines and more. Read more in the [Air documentation](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/), especially about [whether to choose a user or workspace setting for formatting](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/editor-vscode.html#user-vs-workspace-settings).

# Dev Containers Reference Implementation

This folder contains a reference implementation of the MIT-licensed Dev
Containers spec, adapted from:

https://github.com/devcontainers/cli

The reference implementation has been lightly adapted to work in Positron; the
primary change is the adaptation of the Docker/Podman commands to run in
Positron terminals instead of being run directly as child processes.

Positron already includes several extensions to support Python data science, such as Jupyter for notebook support, Ruff for linting and formatting, and Quarto for publishing. 
These come already installed and enabled, so you can start using Python right away without any additional setup.

If you want to add more functionality, you can install additional extensions from the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/) by [browsing in the Extensions tab](command:workbench.extensions.action.focusExtensionsView).

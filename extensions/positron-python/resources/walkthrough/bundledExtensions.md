Positron includes several extensions to support Python development, such as Jupyter notebooks, Ruff for linting and formatting, and Quarto for publishing. 
These are installed automatically the first time you launch Positron.

In addition to these, Positron uses built-in extensions to power core features like the Python backend that connects your code to the IDE interface. 
To view built-in extensions, [open the Extensions tab](command:workbench.extensions.action.focusExtensionsView) and search for `@builtin`. You can further narrow the list by adding a term like `@builtin positron`.

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) with rich support for the [Python language](https://www.python.org/) (_including Python 3.6_), with features including the following and more:
* Linting ([Prospector](https://pypi.io/project/prospector/), [Pylint](https://pypi.io/project/pylint/), [pycodestyle](https://pypi.io/project/pycodestyle/), [Flake8](https://pypi.io/project/flake8/), [pylama](https://github.com/klen/pylama), [pydocstyle](https://pypi.io/project/pydocstyle/), [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) with config files and plugins)
* Intellisense (autocompletion with support for PEP 484 and PEP 526)
* Auto indenting
* Code formatting ([autopep8](https://pypi.io/project/autopep8/), [yapf](https://pypi.io/project/yapf/), with config files)
* Code refactoring (Rename, Extract Variable, Extract Method, Sort Imports)
* Viewing references, code navigation, view signature
* Excellent debugging support (remote debugging over SSH, mutliple threads, django, flask)
* Running and debugging Unit tests ([unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest), [pytest](https://pypi.io/project/pytest/), [nose](https://pypi.io/project/nose/), with config files)
* Execute file or code in a python terminal
* Snippets

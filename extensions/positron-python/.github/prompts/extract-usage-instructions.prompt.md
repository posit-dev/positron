Analyze the user requested part of the codebase (use a suitable <placeholder>) to generate or update `.github/instructions/<placeholder>.instructions.md` for guiding developers and AI coding agents.

Focus on practical usage patterns and essential knowledge:

-   How to use, extend, or integrate with this code area
-   Key architectural patterns and conventions specific to this area
-   Common implementation patterns with code examples
-   Integration points and typical interaction patterns with other components
-   Essential gotchas and non-obvious behaviors

Source existing conventions from `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `README.md`.

Guidelines:

-   Write concise, actionable instructions using markdown structure
-   Document discoverable patterns with concrete examples
-   If `.github/instructions/<placeholder>.instructions.md` exists, merge intelligently
-   Target developers who need to work with or extend this code area

Update `.github/instructions/<placeholder>.instructions.md` with header:

```

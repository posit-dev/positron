- [ ] Create a branch against `release` for a pull request
- [ ] Update the version in [`package.json`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/blob/master/package.json)
- [ ] Run `npm install` to make sure [`package-lock.json`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/blob/master/package.json) is up-to-date (the only update should be the version number if `package-lock.json` has been kept up-to-date)
- [ ] Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
   - [ ] Update version and date for the release section
   - [ ] Run [`news`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/tree/master/news) and copy-and-paste new entries (typically `python news --final | code-insiders -`; quite possibly nothing new to add)
- [ ] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Distribution.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/blob/master/ThirdPartyNotices-Distribution.txt) by running [`tpn`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/tree/master/tpn) (typically `python tpn --npm package-lock.json --npm-overrides package.datascience-ui.dependencies.json --config tpn/distribution.toml ThirdPartyNotices-Distribution.txt`; quite possible there will be no change)
- [ ] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/blob/master/ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt) manually if necessary
- [ ] Merge pull request into `release`
- [ ] Make sure component governance is happy

- [ ] Upload the final `.vsix` file to the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [ ] Publish [documentation changes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pulls)
- [ ] Publish the [blog](http://aka.ms/pythonblog) post
- [ ] Create a [release](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/releases) on GitHub (which creates an appropriate git tag)
- [ ] Determine if a hotfix is needed
- [ ] Merge `release` back into `master`

## Prep for the _next_ release

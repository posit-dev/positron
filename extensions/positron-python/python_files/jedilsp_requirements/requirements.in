# TODO(seem): We're sticking to pydantic v1 since v2 depends on pydantic-core, which only ships
# wheels for CPython and PyPy, and we require impementation-agnostic wheels (via the 'pip install
# --implementation py' arg in scripts/vendoring.py). We inherited that requirement from upstream,
# but we could revisit it.

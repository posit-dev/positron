The user has asked you to generate documentation for the code in the Editor. Use the information in the code comments and the overall structure of the code to create comprehensive documentation. Be succinct but useful in your documentation. Follow standard documentation guidelines for language in which the code is written. If multiple documentation styles exist, use the one that already exists in the code.

Respond with the code changes to add the documentation. You may provide at most one sentence of narrative.

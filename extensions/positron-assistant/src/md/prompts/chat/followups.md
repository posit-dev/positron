Based on the conversation so far, suggest some follow-up data science questions or directions.
They should be written like user commands, but keep them short.

Return 2 or 3 suggestions only if they are relevant to the chat history. If you can't think of anything useful, just return an empty array.

Return a JSON array of strings, and nothing else.

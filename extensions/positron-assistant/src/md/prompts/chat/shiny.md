description: Instructions for the @shiny chat participant
---
<chat-participants>
When the USER asks a question about Shiny, you attempt to respond as normal in the first instance.

If you find you cannot complete the USER’s Shiny request or don’t know the answer to their Shiny question, suggest that they use the `@shiny` command in the chat panel to provide additional support using Shiny Assistant.

If the USER asks you to run or start a Shiny app, you direct them to use the Shiny Assistant, which is able to launch a Shiny app correctly.
